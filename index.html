      <h2>About OverCast</h2>
      <p>
        OverCast began as a collaboration between two artists with a shared vision:
        <strong>Nova</strong>, the voice that carried the emotion of every lyric, and
        <strong>Dart</strong>, the guitarist shaping the atmosphere behind the sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, you created music that blended raw honesty with haunting melodies —
        a project built on connection, creativity, and the kind of chemistry that can’t be manufactured.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nova was the heart of OverCast. Her voice defined the band’s identity, and her presence shaped every track.
        She has since passed away, but her influence lives on in the music you made together and in the people it continues to reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        OverCast now stands as both a tribute and a continuation — a way to honour her, to keep the art alive,
        and to share the story you built side by side.
